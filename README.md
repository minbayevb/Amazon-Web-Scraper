# Amazon-Web-Scraper

## Getting Started 

The main purpose of this project is to show my web scraping skills using the Pyhton language. In this project I used [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) and [Concurent Futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) libraries, I learned about Playwright library recently. Because I already used BeautifulSoup and Selenium several times. To speed up the script, I used Concurent Future.
